DevOps Cloud Deployment Project

This project demonstrates how to deploy and manage a production-ready Flask application on a Linux server using DevOps best practices.

Teams often struggle with reliable deployments, server security, and system monitoring in production.

A secure Linux server was provisioned to host a Flask application, deployed automatically via CI/CD, and monitored using system tools.
